Plugin supports:
- 💾 **Fully customizable config,** allowing you to change prefixes, messages, and cooldown parameters.
- 🤖 **Flexible time formatting:** seconds, minutes, hours, days.
- 🔒 **Full LuckPerms integration:** the plugin automatically detects the player's priority group and applies the corresponding settings.
- 🛸 **Ability to bypass restrictions** for specific groups using the bypass setting.
