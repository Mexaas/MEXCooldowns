MEXCooldowns is a **powerful and user-friendly plugin** for managing command cooldowns on your Minecraft server. It allows you to **easily create** and **configure cooldowns for any command,** as well as fully control their display and behavior for different player groups.

Plugin supports:
- 💾 **Fully customizable config,** allowing you to change prefixes, messages, and cooldown parameters.
- 🤖 **Flexible time formatting:** seconds, minutes, hours, days.
- 🔒 **Full LuckPerms integration:** the plugin automatically detects the player's priority group and applies the corresponding settings.
- 🛸 **Ability to bypass restrictions** for specific groups using the bypass setting.
- 📲 **Easy plugin management** and reloads without errors.
- 💻 **High optimization:** data is stored in a fast runtime mode and only saved to data.yml on shutdown.

In ` runtime mode ` plugin works faster and saves data only on server shutdown at ` data.yml `. After starting the server, all information from ` data.yml ` will load into the plugin's memory for quick access. It makes plugin more optimized
